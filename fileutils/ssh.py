    A concrete FileSystem implementation allowing file operations to be carried

    Instances of SSHFileSystem can be constructed by connecting to a remote

    SSHFileSystem instances have a __del__ that automatically closes their

    need to do anything special with an SSHFileSystem instance when you're done
    with it, although you can force it to close before it's garbage collected
